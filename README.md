VisionAssist is a desktop application designed to support blind and visually impaired individuals in navigating their surroundings with greater independence and confidence. The system addresses the lack of accessible, real-time assistive tools capable of identifying nearby objects and delivering immediate auditory feedback.

The application integrates computer vision with audio interaction to create an interactive environmental awareness system. A webcam continuously captures live video frames, which are processed using object detection and face recognition algorithms.

VisionAssist provides the following core features:

Proximity Alert System: The system emits a beep when the user moves very close to an object, helping prevent collisions.

Face Recognition: It identifies and recalls familiar faces when they are within detection range.

Spatial Awareness Feedback: Detected objects are localized within the camera frame, and their relative position (e.g., left, center, right) is communicated to the user.

Voice-Controlled Object Search: The system accepts spoken input. When a user requests a specific object, VisionAssist searches the scene and announces the object's location relative to the camera.

By combining real-time vision processing, spatial localization, and speech-based interaction, VisionAssist functions as an assistive awareness tool that enhances environmental perception through sound-based feedback.
